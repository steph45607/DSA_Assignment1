1. Insert a new item at the beginning of the array
O(n)
Because it will move the rest of the array to one index and this will use a for loop.
Then can make the 0 index = to the item entered

2. Insert a new item at the end of the array
O(1)
Because it can just use the last or maxSize variable and add it to the back of the array.
No loop needed.

3. Delete an item at the beginning of the array
O(n)
To erase the first value, after it's erased. We have to move the rest of the array up by index 1.
Therefore we will need a loop to re-assign them.

4. Delete an item at the end of the array
O(1)
Can use the last or maxSize variable and erase it.
Then we can decrease the last variable or maxSize variable by 1.
last--; or maxSize--;
